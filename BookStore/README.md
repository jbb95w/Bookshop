# 📚 BookStore (Phase 2 Project)

This is my BookStore app — built with React!  
You can browse books, see details, and add them to a cart but adding to cart dont display it.  
It’s a simple MVP (minimum viable product) version for learning React and routing.

## 🔧 What It Does
- Shows a list of books from the Google Books API  
- Lets users add books to a shopping cart  
- Has a navbar with links for easy navigation  
- Uses clean and responsive design with Tailwind CSS  

## 🧰 Built With
- **React (Vite)**
- **React Router DOM**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## ▶️ How To Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jbb95w/Bookshop.git
2. npm install
3.npm run dev.
