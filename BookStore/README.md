## Description
A modern, responsive Book Store web application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, featuring client-side routing and interactive components. Users can browse books using the Google Books API, search for specific titles, and manage their own reading collection — all within a clean, intuitive interface.

## Core Features
1. Book Search
Users can search for books in real-time through the Google Books API.
The search results are displayed dynamically below the Hero section.

2. Reading Collection
Each book card includes an “Add to Reading Collection” button.
Clicking the Basket icon on the NavBar allows users to view all books they’ve added.

3. User Authentication (Sign Up)
Users can sign up or log in using their email and password via the SignUp component.

4. Routing
Integrated React Router for seamless navigation between pages:
Home – The default landing page displaying the Hero section and search results.
About – Shares details about the app’s purpose and functionality.
Reading Collection – Displays all books added by the user.

5. Modern Styling
Built using Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive, and modern design.
React Icons enhance UI with visual cues (e.g., Basket- Navigation icons).
